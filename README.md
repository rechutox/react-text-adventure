# react-text-adventure

A text game made with react. You can create new stories modifying the story.js file.

The "engine" is node based, so each point in the story is a node. There are two types of nodes: TextNode and ChoiceNode.
The former shows text and a next button and the later shows text and an array of buttons to choose.
